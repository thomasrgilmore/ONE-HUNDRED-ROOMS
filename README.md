# ONE HUNDRED ROOMS

## + ABOUT THE GAME + 

ONE HUNDRED ROOMS is a single script, text-only, rogue-like written in Python. 
Your goal is simple: see your nameless champion safely through one hundred potentially lethal rooms, before the game breaks itself. 
It's minimal and programmatic-generation-focussed. It's another ascii dungeon crawler inspired by the original Rogue, but this time you fight Australian animals for some reason!
